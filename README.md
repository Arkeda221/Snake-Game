### **_Description_**

#### A broswer based video game called Snake. A player controls a snake that roams around a game board, and eats apples, while trying to avoid collisions with the borders of the game board and the snake's tail. As the snake eats more apples, it becomes bigger. If there is a collision with a border of the game board or the snake's tail, it's GAME OVER.
